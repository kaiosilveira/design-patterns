# Mediator Pattern

The **Mediator Pattern** defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Structure

Find below the formal structure definition for the mediator pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram

class Mediator
class ConcreteMediator
class Collegue
class ConcreteCollegue1
class ConcreteCollegue2

Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator : implements
Mediator <-- Collegue : interacts-with
Collegue <|-- ConcreteCollegue1 : implements
Collegue <|-- ConcreteCollegue2 : implements
ConcreteCollegue1 --> ConcreteMediator : interacts-with
ConcreteCollegue2 --> ConcreteMediator : interacts-with
```
